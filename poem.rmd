Along Ocean Highway, apartments rise up  
to ten and twenty stories,  
white, hallucinatory, defying the shifting sand,  
the storm moving in off the Atlantic  
that drives the rain, needlelike,  
across the windshield so that we canâ€™t see,  
so that we stop in Ocean City to wait the storm out  
at the Dutch, the only bar on the boardwalk  
open this time of year, all the concessions  
boarded up, weather-beaten, closed against the season.  

Last summer in violet light, kites  
spiraled downward in loops, then up,  
dragons and birds flying high above the boardwalk.
